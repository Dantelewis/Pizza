  <h2>About Dante </h2>

  <p> I graduated college with a degree in Kinesiology and a minor in nutrition. I became a full time teacher/coach right out of college
    and have not looked back since. I love learning new skills and new imformation. I found that coding can actually be rather enjoyable
    once you work at it.</p>
  <p>As a student at Thinkful, I've started my together my joy of learning and my interest in coding. The experience has been amazing!</p>
  <p> If you're looking to hire a new developer who is eager to learn and problem solve, look no furhter. Iam excited to get the chance 
  to work with other developers who can further my coding prowess even more.</p>
